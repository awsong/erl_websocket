This is a bare minimal Erlang WebSocket implementation, of latest draft-hybi-10,
with both Server and client.

Comparing to previous versions of WebSocket spec, the data framing is much more
efficient. 

Some figures I tested on two virtual machines, each of which has 8G ram and 2 
CPU core of Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5410  @ 2.33GHz
1. Takes about 90s to establish 400K connections.
2. Takes about 5.5G memory in total.
3. Takes 6s to broadcast 512 bytes message to each of the connections. Highest
   bandwidth I saw was about 60M byte/s.
